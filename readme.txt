"SgeNet" folder: use SegNet to complete the rough segmentation of ultrasonic images.
"LNDF" folder: convert the coarse segmentation result into the initialization level set function, and use LNDF to complete the fine segmentation.

This program runs on MATLAB2020a, and later versions should also be available.
