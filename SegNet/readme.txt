Detailed steps of "SegNet" code use:
First, prepare the datasetï¼š
The ultrasonic image of the training data set corresponds to the marking results one by one, and they are placed in "images" and "labels" in "train" respectively. 
Similarly, validation sets and test sets are placed in corresponding folders. The location of all folders needs to be adjusted in the code. 

Then, train the model with "train_Segnet.m" , and use "Segnet_Seg.m" for segmentation.

The segmentation results need to be saved in a folder and converted using "ToBinaryResults. m". Folder name needs to be marked in code.
